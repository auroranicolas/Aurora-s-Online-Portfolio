            Growing up I dabbled.  I tried a varied assortment of things.  I dabbled in swimming, tennis, I even tried my hand at welding.  I am learning two other languages at the present moment, and I did soccer up until last year.  However, as I came of age, the fog began to lift and my passions became clear.  So, after years of dabbling, I laid down my goggles, and my racket, and decided what it was that made me tick.  One of the few things that I realized I had passion for were animals.  I discovered this through 4-H.  In 4-H I am a part of many animal projects.  For example, cavy, rabbit, poultry and many more.  And it is through these projects that my passion for animals, as well as science became clear.  When I grow up I plan to go to college and get the necessary degrees to reach my goal.  I plan to get a job as an animal scientist so that I can make a difference.  But first, I will power through, and work hard in 4-H so that I can be an animal scientist when I grow up.
However, not only do I have ideals of what I want to do in the future but I also have passions for the present.  In my spare time I do many things.  I am learning German, running daily, and getting ahead in math.  I also like to write.  I tinker with my stories, to make them perfect.  I rewrite until I am satisfied, and sometimes I will even just rewrite it from scratch.   But I don't do it daily to get good, but because I have a passion for it.
